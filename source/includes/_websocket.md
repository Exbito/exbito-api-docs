# Websocket

In case you need the realtime data, we encourage you to use the websocket endpoint. Most of the realtime data is
available as websocket channels.

You need to establish a websocket connection to our websocket endpoint:
```
wss://wsapi.exbito.com/wsapiv2
```

Please note that each Client or IP address can have at most 5 simultaneous connections.
